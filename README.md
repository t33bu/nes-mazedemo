# My first NES program

This program is the result of experimenting with NES programming using the C programming language and minimal assembly. 

Maze is hardcoded into the program, but hero uses depth-first-search to find a way out from the maze. Sprites are used for the hero and exit, otherwise the background is tiles, modified show the maze and mark the traversed route with breadcrumbs. 

A [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5sn4rrUSHI) showing how the demo runs.

Also the code examples at [8bitworkshop.com](https://8bitworkshop.com/) were a great help.
